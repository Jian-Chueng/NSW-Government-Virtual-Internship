Your first task is based around a digital policy scenario. Where you don’t have the requisite information to produce an answer, feel free to make up the numbers or find some real-life statistics. 

1. There’s been a three-fold increase in complaints about data breaches in NSW. Write a short paragraph that scopes out two policy ideas you could pitch to solve this problem.

   Two very good policies: 

   - **Business continuity and disaster recovery plans** which are tested, documented and printed in hardcopy with a softcopy stored offline. Focus on the highest priority systems and data to recover.
   - **System recovery capabilities** e.g. virtualisation with snapshot backups, remotely installing operating systems and applications on computers, approved enterprise mobility, and onsite vendor support contracts.

2. The Secretary has asked for top-level details about the data breaches project. Draft an email to the Secretary to explain the key benefits of a project to reduce data breaches and how they should talk about it. 

   **Malicious insiders who steal** data:

   1. Implement ‘Control removable storage media and connected devices’ to mitigate data exfiltration.
   2. Implement ‘Outbound web and email data loss prevention’.
   3. Implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to:
      1. limit the extent of cyber security incidents
      2. detect cyber security incidents and respond.
   4. Repeat step 3 with ‘excellent’ mitigation strategies.
   5. Implement ‘Personnel management’.
   6. If employees are likely to have hacking skills and tools, implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to prevent malware delivery and execution, and repeat step 3 with less effective mitigation strategies until an acceptable level of residual risk is reached.
